# four important column types
## column_id
- This column indicates which entities the time series belong to.
- Features will be extracted individually for each entity. 
- The resulting feature matrix will contain one row per entity. 
- Each robot is a different entity, so each of it has a different id.
## column_sort
- This column contains values which allow to sort the time series (e.g. **time stamps**).
- If you omit this column, the DataFrame is assumed to be already sorted in increasing order.
- note that none of the algorithms of tsfresh uses the actual values in this time column - but only their **sorting order**.
## column_kind
- This column indicates the names of the different time series feature types.
- (E.g. different sensors in an industrial application as in the robot dataset). 
- For each kind of time series the features are calculated individually.
- None of these columns is allowed to contain any `NaN`, `Inf` or `-Inf` values.
## column_value
- This column contains the actual values of the time series. 
# Input Option 
## 1. Flat DataFrame
| id | time | x        | y        |
| -- | ---- | -        | -        |
| A  | t1   | x(A, t1) | y(A, t1) |
| A  | t2   | x(A, t2) | y(A, t2) |
| A  | t3   | x(A, t3) | y(A, t3) |
| B  | t1   | x(B, t1) | y(B, t1) |
| B  | t2   | x(B, t2) | y(B, t2) |
| B  | t3   | x(B, t3) | y(B, t3) |

```python3
column_id="id", column_sort="time", column_kind=None, column_value=None
```
## 2. Stacked DataFrame
| id | time | kind | value    |
| -- | ---- | ---- | -----    |
| A  | t1   | x    | x(A, t1) |
| A  | t2   | x    | x(A, t2) |
| A  | t3   | x    | x(A, t3) |
| A  | t1   | y    | y(A, t1) |
| A  | t2   | y    | y(A, t2) |
| A  | t3   | y    | y(A, t3) |
| B  | t1   | x    | x(B, t1) |
| B  | t2   | x    | x(B, t2) |
| B  | t3   | x    | x(B, t3) |
| B  | t1   | y    | y(B, t1) |
| B  | t2   | y    | y(B, t2) |
| B  | t3   | y    | y(B, t3) |

```python3
column_id="id", column_sort="time", column_kind="kind", column_value="value"
```
## 3. Dictionary of flat DataFrames
{ "x":

   | id | time | value    |
   | -- | ---- | -----    |
   | A  | t1   | x(A, t1) |
   | A  | t2   | x(A, t2) |
   | A  | t3   | x(A, t3) |
   | B  | t1   | x(B, t1) |
   | B  | t2   | x(B, t2) |
   | B  | t3   | x(B, t3) |
    
,
"y":

   | id | time | value    |
   | -- | ---- | -----    |
   | A  | t1   | y(A, t1) |
   | A  | t2   | y(A, t2) |
   | A  | t3   | y(A, t3) |
   | B  | t1   | y(B, t1) |
   | B  | t2   | y(B, t2) |
   | B  | t3   | y(B, t3) |

}
```python3
column_id="id", column_sort="time", column_kind=None, column_value="value"
```
# Output Format
- The resulting feature matrix for all three input options will be the same. 
- It will always be a `pandas.DataFrame` with the following layout

| id | x_feature_1 | ... | x_feature_N | y_feature_1 | ... | y_feature_N |
| -- | ----------- | --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| A  | ...         | ... | ...         | ...         | ... | ...         |
| B  | ...         | ... | ...         | ...         | ... | ...         |

- where the x features are calculated using all x values (independently for A and B), y features using all y values and so on.
- This form of DataFrame is also the expected input format to the feature selection algorithms (e.g. the `tsfresh.select_features()` function).
