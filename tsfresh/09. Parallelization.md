feature extraction and feature selection offer parallelization.
- `multiprocessing.Pool` 的两个重要参数
  - *n_jobs*
  - *chunksize*
  
## n_jobs
- set the Pool’s number of worker processes to *n_jobs*. 
- This field defaults to the number of processors on the current system. 
- We recommend setting it to the maximum number of available (and otherwise idle) processors. 建议最大值
  
## chunksize
- One data chunk is defined as a singular time series for one id and one kind. 
  - 疑问: 一个数据块 被定义为 某一id的某一kind的一个时间序列值?
- The chunksize is the number of chunks that are submitted as one task to one worker process.
- If you set the chunksize to 10, then it means that one worker task corresponds to calculate all features for 10 id/kind time series combinations.
  - 疑问: 设置为10 意味着 一个任务计算所有特征, 每个特征为10个 data chunk 的组合值?
